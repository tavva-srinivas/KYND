1) Block provider in the material app widget so all the widgets that are child can use it using
   BlocBuilder.of<CounterCubit>(context).increment()
--> A UNIQUE INSTANCE OF A BLOCK (block provider)

2) BlockBuilder for Re-building the UI based on STATE CHANGE
   widget <-----> cubit/block

   using BlocBuilder : the builder function maybe called multiple times per state due to flutter engine

   So,
3) BLockListener : the listener is called only once per state

4) BlockConsumer : Combines BlocBuilder + BlocConsumer

5) RepositoryProvider : A UNIQUE INSTANCE OF REPOSITORY

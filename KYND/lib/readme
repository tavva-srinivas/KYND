# Basic GetX Commands

### GetBuilder
`GetBuilder` is used to update a widget's state in response to changes in a controller. It listens to changes in the specified controller and rebuilds the widget whenever the controller's state changes.

### GetX
`GetX` is a lightweight alternative to `GetBuilder`. It's used to listen to changes in a controller and rebuilds the widget whenever the controller's state changes. It automatically disposes itself when the widget is removed from the widget tree.

### Get.put
`Get.put` is used to register a controller globally so that it can be accessed from anywhere in the app using `Get.find()`.

### Get.find
`Get.find` is used to retrieve a globally registered instance of a controller.

### Get.offAll
`Get.offAll` is used to navigate to a new screen and remove all previous screens from the navigation stack. It's useful for performing a full-screen replacement, such as navigating to the home screen after completing an onboarding process.

# Some Experiences

### Initialization of UserProvider
You're using `Get.put(User_provider())` inside the build method of your `Home_Screen` widget. This approach is not recommended because it will recreate the `User_provider` instance every time the build method is called, which can lead to unexpected behavior and performance issues. Instead, you should initialize `User_provider` once, preferably in a higher-level widget, such as the `main.dart` file.

# When the Factory Constructor Can Return Existing Instances

If you modify the factory constructor to include logic for returning existing instances (like a cache), it might return the same instance for certain conditions. Here's an example of such logic:

```dart
class Product_summary {
  final String id;
  final String name;

  // Private constructor
  Product_summary._internal({required this.id, required this.name});

  // Static cache to store instances
  static final Map<String, Product_summary> _cache = {};

  // Factory constructor with caching logic
  factory Product_summary.from_json(Map<String, dynamic> json) {
    final id = json['_id'];
    if (_cache.containsKey(id)) {
      return _cache[id]!;
    } else {
      final instance = Product_summary._internal(
        id: id,
        name: json['name'],
      );
      _cache[id] = instance;
      return instance;
    }
  }
}

void main() {
  // First JSON object
  Map<String, dynamic> json1 = {
    '_id': '123',
    'name': 'Product 1'
  };

  // Another JSON object with the same id as json1
  Map<String, dynamic> json3 = {
    '_id': '123',
    'name': 'Updated Product 1'
  };

  // Create instances using the factory constructor
  Product_summary product1 = Product_summary.from_json(json1);
  Product_summary product3 = Product_summary.from_json(json3);

  // Print the product details
  print('Product 1 ID: ${product1.id}, Name: ${product1.name}');
  print('Product 3 ID: ${product3.id}, Name: ${product3.name}');

  // Check if they are the same instance
  print(identical(product1, product3)); // true, they are the same instance
}

When the Factory Constructor Can Return Existing Instances
If you modify the factory constructor to include logic for returning existing instances (like a cache), it might return the same instance for certain conditions. Here's an example of such logic:

dart
Copy code
class Product_summary {
  final String id;
  final String name;

  // Private constructor
  Product_summary._internal({required this.id, required this.name});

  // Static cache to store instances
  static final Map<String, Product_summary> _cache = {};

  // Factory constructor with caching logic
  factory Product_summary.from_json(Map<String, dynamic> json) {
    final id = json['_id'];
    if (_cache.containsKey(id)) {
      return _cache[id]!;
    } else {
      final instance = Product_summary._internal(
        id: id,
        name: json['name'],
      );
      _cache[id] = instance;
      return instance;
    }
  }
}

void main() {
  // First JSON object
  Map<String, dynamic> json1 = {
    '_id': '123',
    'name': 'Product 1'
  };

  // Another JSON object with the same id as json1
  Map<String, dynamic> json3 = {
    '_id': '123',
    'name': 'Updated Product 1'
  };

  // Create instances using the factory constructor
  Product_summary product1 = Product_summary.from_json(json1);
  Product_summary product3 = Product_summary.from_json(json3);

  // Print the product details
  print('Product 1 ID: ${product1.id}, Name: ${product1.name}');
  print('Product 3 ID: ${product3.id}, Name: ${product3.name}');

  // Check if they are the same instance
  print(identical(product1, product3)); // true, they are the same instance
}
Explanation of Modified Example
Static Cache: _cache stores instances by their id.
Checking Cache: In the factory constructor, before creating a new instance, it checks if an instance with the same id already exists in the cache.
Returning Cached Instance: If it exists, the existing instance is returned. If not, a new instance is created, added to the cache, and then returned.
In this modified example, if you call the factory constructor with the same id, it will return the cached instance, demonstrating how a factory constructor can manage instance creation logic more flexibly.

what exactly is the difference between const and final keywords
1) const values are compile-time constants.
2) final values are run-time constants.
